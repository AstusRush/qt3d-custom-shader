# qt3d-custom-shader
Learning Qt3D with Custom Shader.

# NOTE
I am unable to make the shaders work in pyqt3d.
If anyone knows how to get shaders working please open an issue and tell me how!
For now I will wait until qt3d and its Python bindings are more developed. Maybe with Qt6...

## Billboards
https://github.com/wonder-sk/qt3d-experiments/tree/master/billboards is the QML version. <br>
https://github.com/ismailsunni/qt3d-custom-shader is the C++ version. <br>
This fork is the Python version.<br>

Below is a screenshot and an animated gif from the C++ Version:
